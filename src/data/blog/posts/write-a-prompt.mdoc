- **Persona:** Define the role the AI should assume (e.g., "You are a marketing analyst," "Act as an experienced travel agent") to influence the tone, style, and viewpoint of the response.

- **Task:** State the specific action or objective you want the AI to accomplish. Start with strong action verbs like "Write," "Summarize," "Explain," or "Translate"

- **Context:** Provide relevant background information or details about the situation, target audience, or purpose. This helps the AI understand the setting and tailor its response appropriately.

- **Format:** Specify the desired structure or presentation for the output (e.g., "in a bulleted list," "a three-paragraph email," "under 100 words," "using a professional tone").&nbsp;
